We know that queen is a powerful piece and it is like union of bishop and rook. 
Since the problem only wants the number of necassary pieces not the types of them, we can ignore bishop and rook. 
Knight is a piece with a limited funcitonality so at the beginning I decided to try solutions with 1, 2 and 3 queens.

So algorithm works like this:
- First we try one queen.
- There are 64 (minus white kings' positions) to try
- For each position we first put the Q in that square
- We control if each of the white kings are in check position at this placement
- Each king has 8 places to escape
- For each move we control if both kings are still in check position.
- If we find a placement that meets all the necessary conditions then we print the result.
- Else we continue and try for 2Qs and 3Qs.
