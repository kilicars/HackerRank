First thing I have noticed was that the problem was asking the number of combinations from a set with duplicates 
as each combination can be sorted in eachself. Let's take the sample in the question:

n = 3 m = 3 k = 2
So set = {1,1,2,2,3,3} and we should find distinct sets with 3 elements

To find this number we should find the coeffient of x^n in the expasion of (1+x+x^2+....+x^k)^m. 
You can check the proof from [here](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56197.html).

So for the sample we should find the coefficient of x^3 in the expansion of (1+x+x^2)^3.

Coming so far was easy for me but finding the coefficent part was difficult. I have searched a lot on the net, 
read posts and even wathed a video :) but the maths was beyond my level and I was about to give up. 
At last, I came accross [this post](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-find-the-coefficient-of-x-5-in-the-expansion-of-1+x+x-2-6/answer/Nick-Shales?srid=uEfHB) in quora. This is very easy to understand and visual method based on Pascal triangle. 
I highly suggest you take a glance at that.
