First observation was there were only two groups: RB and GW. So each number in the array would be element of one of these. 
As there are only two groups and we can move from any number in one group to any number in the other group and we can start 
anywhere(in choosing the first group and element), if we sort the elements of the array and give a color specifying the group 
then we can find the length of LIS from this color sequence.

I will explain this by the sample I have made up:

11
WBGRWBBGBRW
1000 3 858 100000 36 37 38 39 103 105 1
    
The elements in the first list (R) are:
3 37 38 103 105 100000
The elements in the second list (G) are: 
1 36 39 858 1000
    
After sorting the array we get:
1 3 36 37 38 39 103 105  858 1000 100000
G R  G  R  R  G   R   R    G   G       R

First, we see that we cannot use both 37 and 38 as they are in the same group(like 103-105 and 858-1000) in the increasing 
subsequence so our first result = 8.
    
Next, one can observe that if she takes one of the excess Gs in between of excess R.s or vice versa then she can increase 
the length of the increasing subsequence. 
    
For this example there are 2 excess Rs and 1 excess G. So if we take one excess G(say 858) and put it between excess 
Rs(say between 37 and 38) then our result becomes 9. This the end because no more excess G left.
