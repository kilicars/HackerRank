Let k = 3 as in the sample. Then our set is {1,2,3}. Think it as a tree with root 1. Then the leaves of 1 can be 2 and 3. 
In the next level, 2 can have children 1 and 3 and 3 has children 1 and 2. This tree can grow until we reach the level = n. 
Then we look at the leaves and we count the leaves with the number x on it.(You'll see it better if you draw the tree on a paper)

Now let's count the number of 1s,2s and 3s at each level

1 2 3
-----
1 0 0
0 1 1
2 1 1
2 3 3
6 5 5

Do you see the pattern?

Each number's count = Sum of it's complements in the previous level. 
And the counts of numbers except 1 are equal to each other. Let's call it "a".
And let's call count of 1 as "b".
So we can generalize the formula as
b(at current level) = (k - 1) * a(at prev level)
a(at current level) = (k - 2) * a(at prev level) + b(at prev level)
